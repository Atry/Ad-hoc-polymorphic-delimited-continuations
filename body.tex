\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}


DSL operators in our framework can be adaptive to its specific domain. A DSL user can create a single function that contains interleaved different DSLs implemented from different vendors, along with ordinary Scala control flows.

 
In functional programming, imperative control flow can be composed from monads\cite{wadler1990comprehending,wadler1992essence,jones1993composing}.
Along with monad transformers\cite{liang1995monad} and \lstinline{do} or \lstinline{for} comprehension\cite{jones1998haskell,odersky2004scala}, the ability of control flow

We show how a set of building blocks can be used to construct
programming language interpreters, and present implementations
of such building blocks capable of supporting many
commonly known features, including simple expressions,
three different function call mechanisms (call-by-name, call-by-value and lazy evaluation), references and assignment,
nondeterminism, first-class continuations, and program tracing.
